# Enigma's Diablo Trainer

Simple trainer for Blizzard's Diablo I, uses the Windows UI handle to give access to Diablo's memory space.  In this game, the Character's stats are stored client-side, *and* the memory offsets are not randomized--making modifications to any stat that can be deduced from differential Hex-ing is trivial.

Trainer was written with Visual C++ for Win32 systems.
